# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical issues in the Cat Roulette application, including non-functional spin mechanism, test failures, and HTML validation errors that prevent proper deployment.

## Glossary

- **Cat_Roulette_System**: The web-based interactive cat roulette wheel application
- **Wheel_Segments**: Visual divisions of the roulette wheel displaying cat images
- **Spin_Mechanism**: The functionality that rotates the wheel and selects a random cat
- **Test_Suite**: The automated testing system in test-roulette.html
- **HTML_Validator**: The deployment validation system checking HTML compliance
- **Global_Functions**: JavaScript functions accessible throughout the application

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the roulette wheel to spin and display cat segments, so that I can interact with the game properly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads, THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL create visual Wheel_Segments for each cat image
2. WHEN a user clicks the spin button, THE Spin_Mechanism SHALL rotate the wheel with visible cat segments
3. WHEN the wheel stops spinning, THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL highlight the selected cat segment
4. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL display cat images within each Wheel_Segment during the spin animation
5. WHEN the wheel is spinning, THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL show smooth visual rotation of all segments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass in the test suite, so that I can verify the application works correctly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN test-roulette.html is loaded, THE Test_Suite SHALL find all required Global_Functions
2. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL provide showUserFeedback as a globally accessible function
3. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL provide showNetworkStatus as a globally accessible function
4. WHEN tests are executed, THE Test_Suite SHALL report zero failed tests for core functionality
5. THE Global_Functions SHALL maintain consistent behavior between main application and test environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a deployment system, I want the HTML to be valid, so that the application can be deployed successfully

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL ensure no img elements have empty src attributes
2. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL use only valid CSS property values
3. WHEN HTML_Validator runs, THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL produce zero validation errors
4. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL provide fallback src values for all image elements
5. THE Cat_Roulette_System SHALL use standard CSS values for all media queries and properties
